## Programming Assignment 2
## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix 
## If the inverse has already been calculated, then retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
